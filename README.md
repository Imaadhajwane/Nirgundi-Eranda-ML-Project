# Nirgundi and Eranda ML Project

Welcome to the Nirgundi and Eranda ML Project! This repository contains the work for my major project in the final year, focusing on plant health detection for Nirgundi and Erenda leaves.

## Overview

The project aims to develop a machine learning model for detecting the health status of Nirgundi and Erenda leaves using advanced image analysis techniques.

## Contents

- **Literature Survey**: A PDF document providing an in-depth literature review of the methodologies and background information relevant to the project.
- **UML Diagrams**: A folder containing the following diagrams that outline the system's design and architecture:
```
  - **System Architecture Diagram**
  - **Data Flow Diagrams**
  - **Use Case Diagram**
  - **Activity Diagram**
  - **Sequence Diagram**
  - **State Diagram**
  - **Deployment Diagram**
  - **Component Diagram**
  - **Class Diagram**
```

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, please review the literature survey and UML diagrams to understand the system's architecture and design.
